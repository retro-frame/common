1. INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================


1.1 Background
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[RETRO-FRAME] is a Retro-Endeavor that provides common documentation (i.e.
definitions, guidelines and templates) as well as specifications which are
intended for use in retrospective programming and may be used as a whole or
partially for other purposes.

As Retro-Frame is evolving, declarations of compliance should always refer to a
specific release version. If a general intention of compliance is expressed, a
reference to the major version may be given by "Retro-Frame 1.x". However, an
actual reference should specify the minor version as well (e.g. "Retro-Frame
1.0").

Note that the individual Retro-Frame specifications (e.g. data formats) may use
independent version numbers.


1.2 Scope
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document provides a SPECIFICATION of Retro-Frame characters, which are a
superset of [UNICODE], and character encodings.

2. CHARACTER PROPERTIES
===============================================================================


2.1 Categories
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each Retro-Frame codepoint is assigned to a category. The categories are
related to one or more general categories defined by [UNICODE]:

  Category        Unicode category            Unicode basic type
  --------------  --------------------------  ------------------
  Grapheme        Letter, uppercase           Graphic
                  Letter, lowercase           Graphic
                  Letter, titlecase           Graphic
                  Letter, modifier            Graphic
                  Letter, other               Graphic
                  Mark, nonspacing            Graphic

                  Number, letter              Graphic
                  Number, other               Graphic
                  Punctuation, connector      Graphic
                  Punctuation, dash           Graphic
                  Punctuation, open           Graphic
                  Punctuation, close          Graphic
                  Punctuation, initial quote  Graphic
                  Punctuation, final quote    Graphic
                  Punctuation, other          Graphic
                  Symbol, math                Graphic
                  Symbol, currency            Graphic
                  Symbol, modifier            Graphic
                  Symbol, other               Graphic
  Spacing         Separator, space            Graphic
  Control         Separator, line             Format
                  Separator, paragraph        Format
                  Other, control              Control
                  Other, format               Format
  No-character    Other, surrogate            Surrogate
                  Other, not assigned         Noncharacter
  Unspecified     Other, private use          Private-use
                  Other, not assigned         Reserved

As each Unicode codepoint is assigned to exactly one Unicode general category,
the assignment to a Retro-Frame character category can be derived (implicit
assignment). All non-Unicode codepoints are explicitly assigned to a category
(see chapter 3).


2.2 Names
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All grapheme, spacing, control as well as the Retro-Frame defined no-character
codepoints have a name assigned.

For grapheme and spacing characters, the [UNICODE] names are used in lowercase
letters, if available. Otherwise (i.e. for Retro-Frame defined grapheme and
spacing characters), an individual name is assigned (see chapter 3.2). Aliases
may be used but are not considered the name. If a character name is formally
used, all letters are uppercase and spaces are replaced by low lines ('_').

For Unicode control characters, the [UNICODE] abbreviations (which are all
spelled in uppercase letters), if given, are used as names. The aliases may
be used but are not considered the name. For Retro-Frame defined control
characters, similar names are assigned (see chapter 3.2).

While Unicode no-character codepoints do not have a name assigned, Retro-Frame
defined codepoints have a name in uppercase letters and optional low lines (see
chapter 3.3).


2.3 Line breaks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following [UNICODE] control characters are considered a line break if not
specified otherwise in a specific context:

- 0x000A  LF (line feed)
- 0x000B  VT (vertical tab)
- 0x000C  FF (form feed)
- 0x000D  CR (carriage return)
- 0x0085  NEL (next line)
- 0x2028  LS (line separator)
- 0x2029  PS (paragraph separator)

If a CR is immediately followed by an LF, or vice versa, the combination is
considered a single line break. Retro-Frame defines extended characters to
represent such combinations (see chapter 3.2).


2.4 Whitespace
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whitespace are considered word separators. While a line break (see chapter 2.3)
is always a word separator, the following [UNICODE] characters are considered a
whitespace (i.e. a word separator) if not specified otherwise in a specific
context:

- 0x0009  HT (horizontal tab)
- 0x0020  ' ' (space)

Thus, other characters of the category spacing are, in general, not considered
a whitespace.


2.5 Digits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retro-Frame defines the codepoints 0x0030..0x0039 ('0'..'9') as decimal digits.


2.6 Letters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retro-Frame defines the codepoints 0x0041..0x005A ('A'..'Z') as uppercase
letters and the codepoints 0x0061..0x007A ('a'..'z') as lowercase letters.
Together, these are the (only) letters.



3. CHARACTER CODEPOINTS
===============================================================================


3.1 Unicode characters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The range 0x000000..0x10FFFF of a Retro-Frame character is specified as the
[UNICODE] character of the corresponding codepoint.

Note that the following codepoints of Unicode must never be used:

- 0x00D800..0x00DFFF  (may be used as surrogates in UTF-16)
- 0x00FDD0..0x00FDEF
- 0x0?FFFE..0x0?FFFF  (? = 0..F)
- 0x10FFFE..0x10FFFF

However, if such codepoints occur, they may be preserved by direct encoding
(see chapter 3.4). Note that in this case the codepoints change (e.g. sorting
may produce different results than if those codepoints, although invalid, were
left unchanged).


3.2 Extended characters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The range 0x110000..0x110136 of Retro-Frame character codepoints is reserved
for extended characters.

The following extended characters are defined:

  Codepoint  Name  Category  Description
  ---------  ----  --------  -------------------------------------------------
  0x110000   CRLF  Control   Represents a CR/LF sequence as a single character
                             and is considered a line break (see chapter 2.3)
  0x110001   LFCR  Control   Represents a LF/CR sequence as a single character
                             and is considered a line break (see chapter 2.3)

The remaining, currently unspecified codepoints 0x110002..0x110136 are
reserved.


3.3 No-characters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The range 0x110137..0x800000 of Retro-Frame character codepoints is reserved
for no-characters. No-characters may be used to encode additional information
or states (e.g. error codes) by a character type.

With regards to 16 bit character implementations (see chapter 5.2), this range
is divided into a low range codepoints (which can be represented by 16 bit
characters) and a high range codepoints (which cannot be represented by 16 bit
characters).

The following no-characters are defined in the low range:

- 0x110137              NO_CHAR (generic no-character)
- 0x110138..0x0011017F  private use area (will always remain unspecified)
- 0x110180              PATH_SEPARATOR
- 0x110181..0x001101FF  (reserved)

The following no-characters are defined in the high range:

- 0x110200..0x007FF7FF  (reserved)
- 0x800000..0x00FFFFFF  private use area (will always remain unspecified)


3.4 Direct encodings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Direct encoding is a feature to preserve a character value of arbitrary bit
length which cannot or should not be mapped to a defined codepoint. However,
lengths of more than 29 bits require one or even more shifted part so that in
this case, a direct encoding is restricted to a string.

The following ranges are defined for direct encoding:

- 0x01000000              arbitrary bit length direct encoding of shift parts
- 0x01000001              0 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000002..0x01000003  1 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000004..0x01000007  2 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000008..0x0100000F  3 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000010..0x0100001F  4 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000020..0x0100003F  5 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000040..0x0100007F  6 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000080..0x010000FF  7 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000100..0x010001FF  8 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000200..0x010003FF  9 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000400..0x010007FF  10 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01000800..0x01000FFF  11 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01001000..0x01001FFF  12 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01002000..0x01003FFF  13 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01004000..0x01007FFF  14 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01008000..0x0100FFFF  15 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01010000..0x0101FFFF  16 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01020000..0x0103FFFF  17 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01040000..0x0107FFFF  18 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01080000..0x010FFFFF  19 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01100000..0x011FFFFF  20 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01200000..0x013FFFFF  21 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01400000..0x017FFFFF  22 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x01800000..0x01FFFFFF  23 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x02000000..0x02FFFFFF  24 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x03000000..0x04FFFFFF  25 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x05000000..0x08FFFFFF  26 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x09000000..0x10FFFFFF  27 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x11000000..0x20FFFFFF  28 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x21000000..0x40FFFFFF  29 bit direct encoding, low part
- 0x41000000..0x80FFFFFF  30 bit direct encoding, shift part

If n shift parts precede an m bit low part of a direct encoding, the total bit
length of the resulting value is n * 30 + m. If n and m are zero (i.e. the
direct encoding codepoint 0x01000001 occurs without any preceding shift part),
direct encoding of zero bits which does never match. However, the codepoint
0x01000001, which matches any bit length, may exist without a preceding shift
part and result in a codepoint of zero. If n is greater than 1, the shift parts
must be in big endian order (i.e. the most significant bits are in the first
shift part). A shift part must be followed by another shift part or a direct
encoding low part.

Direct encodings are not not assigned to a category. There should be no
interpretation of direct encodings and processing is limited to copying or
deleting.


3.5 String terminators
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

String terminators indicate the end of a character string (see chapter 5.3).

The following ranges are defined for string terminators:

- 0x81000000..0xFFFFFFFD  unspecified string terminator
- 0xFFFFFFFE              TRUNCATED (string resulted from a longer string)
- 0xFFFFFFFF              TERMINATED (normal end of string)

While two string terminators, TRUNCATED and TERMINATED, have a predefined
meanings, unspecified string terminators may be used to encode further string
information (e.g. the original encoding of a string). They may also be used to
indicate errors on character or string operations (in this case, they may also
be used as a value of a single character).



4. PRINTABLE AND REPLACEMENT CHARACTERS
===============================================================================


4.1 Level 1 (minimum printable)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The characters of the MINIMAL CHARACTER SET are expected to be printable in all
environments (level 1).

However, as this set of printable characters is extremely limited, it should
be used only if it is important that output is accurate on all systems.

A character which is not printable may be omitted or replaced by a question
mark ('?').


4.2 Level 2 (basic printable)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The characters of the BASIC CHARACTER SET are expected to be printable in most
environments which are in primary scope of Retro-Frame (level 2).

In this level, the following characters are considered the same codepoint even
if the grapheme is different:

- If the dollar sign (codepoint 0x24, '$') is not printable, it may be
  represented by a generic currency symbol (codepoint 0xA4 otherwise).

- If the circumflex accent (caret, codepoint 0x5E, '^') is not printable, it
  may be represented by an upwards arrow (codepoint 0x2191 otherwise).

A character which is not printable may be omitted, escaped (see chapter 5.5) or
replaced by a question mark ('?').


4.3 Level 3 (standard printable)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The characters of the STANDARD CHARACTER SET are printable in all ASCII
environments and even in most EBCDIC environments (level 3).

A character which is not printable may be omitted, escaped (see chapter 5.5) or
replaced by a question mark ('?').


4.4 Level 4 (codepage printable)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a CODEPAGE is used, all grapheme or spacing CODEPOINTS are printable. Note
that this level may not entail all the printable characters of the previous
levels. However, in this level all printable characters of the CODEPAGE are
covered.

A character which is not printable may be omitted, escaped (see chapter 5.5) or
replaced by a question mark ('?') respectively a CODEPAGE-specific replacement
character.


4.5 Level 5 (Unicode printable)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Unicode is used, all grapheme or spacing CODEPOINTS are printable. However,
for characters other than ASCII (i.e. CODEPOINTS > 0x007F), it depends on the
chosen font whether or not a character is actually printable.

It is expected that a character which is not printable is implicitly omitted or
replaced in a system-dependent manner. However, if a character is intentionally
replaced, the Unicode replacement character (0xFFFD) shall be used.

If it is important that all printable characters are actually represented, only
CODEPOINTS of the STANDARD CHARACTER SET (i.e. ASCII printable) shall be used
and all other CODEPOINTS shall be escaped (see chapter 5.5). In this case, it
must be considered whether the line break CODEPOINTS 0x0085 NEL, 0x2028 LS and
0x2029 PS shall be translated to 0x000D CR and/or 0x000A LF or escaped.


5. ENCODING
===============================================================================


5.1 Internal 32 bit representation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If 32 bit integers are supported by the environment, codepoints should be
represented by a 32 bit unsigned integer value.

In this case, all codepoints can be represented by a single value. However,
direct encodings of more than 29 bits require shifted high parts and are thus
only representable by a character string (see chapter 3.4).


5.2 Internal 16 bit representation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Retro-Frame character may be implemented by 16 bit unsigned integer values
with some limitations under the following rules:

- Unicode codepoints > 0xFFFF are represented as UTF-16 (i.e. a high surrogate
  immediately followed by a low surrogate).

- Extended characters are represented in the range 0xD800..0xD936 (i.e. a low
  surrogate which was not predeced by a high surrogate).

- No-characters are limited to the low range codepoints and represented in the
  range 0xD937..0xD9FF (i.e. a low surrogate which was not predeced by a high
  surrogate and surrogates cannot be represented as a no-character).

- Direct encodings are limited to 8 bit in the range 0xDA00..0xDAFF with 8 bit
  shifts in the range 0xDB00..0xDBFF (i.e. a low surrogate which was not
  predeced by a high surrogate):

  - 0xDA00          arbitrary bit length direct encoding of shift parts
  - 0xDA01          0 bit direct encoding, low part
  - 0xDA02..0xDA03  1 bit direct encoding, low part
  - 0xDA04..0xDA07  2 bit direct encoding, low part
  - 0xDA08..0xDA0F  3 bit direct encoding, low part
  - 0xDA10..0xDA1F  4 bit direct encoding, low part
  - 0xDA20..0xDA3F  5 bit direct encoding, low part
  - 0xDA40..0xDA7F  6 bit direct encoding, low part
  - 0xDA80..0xDAFF  7 bit direct encoding, low part
  - 0xDB00..0xDBFF  8 bit direct encoding, shift part

- String terminators are limited to TRUNCATED (0xFFFE) and TERMINATED (0xFFFF).
  

5.3 Character Strings (CS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A character string (CS) is a sequence of Retro-Frame character values and may
be terminated by a string terminator (see chapter 3.5). However, the count of
valid characters in a string may also be maintained in a different way (e.g. a
leading count value or if the string is at the end of a delimited data format).

While the string count is always the number of valid character values
(excluding string terminators, if given), the string length may be defined in
the specific context. While characters (including control characters) should
always be counted, no-characters and direct encodings may or may not be counted
(however, in any case, the shift part of a direct encoding as well as string
terminators should never be counted for the string length).


5.4 Packed Character Strings (PCS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A packed character string (PCS) is a sequence of one to three bytes (i.e. 8 bit
unsigned integer values) in big endian order (i.e. the values representing the
most significant bits come first) that are used to represent the Retro-Frame
character codepoints. Unlike UTF-8, the individual values overlap so that
packed character strings must always be interpreted from the beginning of the
string.

Codepoints are encoded as follows:

- 0x000000..0x0000BF  Codepoints are unchanged and represented by a single
                      byte.

- 0x0000C0..0x002DF4  For encoding, 0x00BF40 is added and the resulting values
                      (0xC000..0xED34) are represented by two bytes.

- 0x002DF5..0x00D7FF  For encoding, 0xED070B is added and the resulting values
                      (0xED3500..0xEDDF0A) are represented by three bytes.

- 0x00E000..0x00FDCF  For encoding, 0xECFF0B is added and the resulting values
                      (0xEDDF0B..0xEDFCDA) are represented by three bytes.

- 0x00FDF0..0x00FFFD  For encoding, 0xECFEEB is added and the resulting values
                      (0xEDFCDB..0xEDFEE8) are represented by three bytes.

- 0x010000..0x01FFFD  For encoding, 0xECFEE9 is added and the resulting values
                      (0xEDFEE9..0xEEFEE6) are represented by three bytes.

- 0x020000..0x02FFFD  For encoding, 0xECFEE7 is added and the resulting values
                      (0xEEFEE7..0xEFFEE4) are represented by three bytes.

- 0x030000..0x03FFFD  For encoding, 0xECFEE5 is added and the resulting values
                      (0xEFFEE5..0xF0FEE2) are represented by three bytes.

- 0x040000..0x04FFFD  For encoding, 0xECFEE3 is added and the resulting values
                      (0xF0FEE3..0xF1FEE0) are represented by three bytes.

- 0x050000..0x05FFFD  For encoding, 0xECFEE1 is added and the resulting values

The following bytes represent string terminators:

- 0xFE  TRUNCATED
- 0xFF  TERMINATED

Thus, a packed character string cannot represent no-characters or direct
encodings.


5.5 Escape sequences
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Retro-Frame characters are represented as text (i.e. printed), non-printable
characters, no-characters and direct encodings have no graphical representation
(i.e. a defined grapheme). In addition, control characters which normally
control output (e.g. a new line), should not be interpreted in some cases (e.g.
if part of a file name).

Those characters may be omitted or replaced by a common replacement character.
However, in this case, the codepoint would be lost on output and it would not
be possible to enter the codepoint on input.

In order to represent a non-printable codepoint, escape sequences may be used.
The default Retro-Frame escape character is the circumflex accent ('^', caret).
However, for local input or output, a native escape character may also be
defined.

If escaping is recognized, the following sequences are defined after the
occurence of an escape character:

- Any character which is neither a digit ('0'..'9') nor a letter ('A'..'Z',
  'a'..'z') stands for itself and will not have a special meaning, even it
  would have one in the specific context (in particular, the escape character
  itself may be represented this way).

- One of the following single characters represent specific characters:
  - 'C' represents codepoint 0x03 (ETX, end of text)
  - 'a' represents codepoint 0x07 (BEL, alert)
  - 'b' represents codepoint 0x08 (BS, backspace)
  - 't' represents codepoint 0x09 (HT, horizontal tab)
  - 'n' represents codepoint 0x0A (LF, line feed)
  - 'v' represents codepoint 0x0B (VT, vertical tab)
  - 'f' represents codepoint 0x0C (FF, form feed)
  - 'r' represents codepoint 0x0D (CR, carriage return)
  - 'Z' represents codepoint 0x1A (SUB, substitute)
  - 'e' represents codepoint 0x1B (ESC, escape)
  - 'X' represents codepoint 0x20 (' ', space)
  - 'D' represents codepoint 0x7F (DEL, delete)
  - 'E' represents codepoint 0x85 (NEL, next line / EOL, end of line)
  - 'L' represents codepoint 0x2028 (LS, line separator)
  - 'P' represents codepoint 0x2029 (PS, paragraph separator)
  - 'R' represents codepoint 0x110000 (CRLF, CR/LF sequence)
  - 'N' represents codepoint 0x110001 (LFCR, LF/CR sequence)

- A sequence of hexadecimal digits in uppercase ('0'..'9', 'A'..'F') represents
  a single codepoint in the range 0x00000000..0x00FFFFFF. A comma (',') after
  the value indicates that another value follows. The sequence of one or more
  values must be terminated by a semicolon (';'). Note that not all such
  codepoints may be representable by 16 bit representations.

- The letter 'x', followed by a sequence of hexadecimal digits in uppercase
  ('0'..'9', 'A'..'F') represents a value which is represented by direct
  encoding. A comma (',') after the value indicates that another value follows.
  A solidus ('/') after one or more values indicates a fixed bit length for the
  direct encoding and the bit length must follow in decimal representation
  (e.g. "/16"). Otherwise, an arbitrary bit length direct encoding is assumed.
  The sequence of one or more values and an option bit length must be
  terminated by a semicolon (';'). Note that a single direct encoding may be
  represented by multiple characters (in this case, all characters but one are
  shift parts). In all cases, leading zeros are ignored on input but should not
  be present at output.

Examples:

- "^^" represents the circumflex accent itself.

- "^t" represents the codepoint 0x09 (HT, horizontal tab).

- "^X" represents the codepoint 0x20 (' ', space).

- "^P" represents the codepoint 0x2029 (PS, paragraph separator).

- "^0;" represents the codepoint 0x00 (NUL, null).

- "^A0;" represents the codepoint 0xA0 (no-break space).

- "^5E,61;" represents the codepoints 0x0000005E and 0x00000061 ("^a") which
  do not in turn represent an escape sequence.

- "^x0;" represents the codepoint 0x01000000 (direct encoding of value zero
  which matches arbitrary bit lengths).

- "^x1,FFFF/24;" represents the codepoints 0x02000001 and 0x0200FFFF (values
  0x000001 and 0x00FFFF of 24 bit direct encoding).

- "^x0/32;" represents the codepoints 0x41000000 and 0x01000004 (value
  0x00000000 zero of 32 bit direct encoding).
